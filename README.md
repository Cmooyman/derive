## Site 1
* https://mastchocolate.com/
* I opened Pinterest and clicked on an appealing picture and followed the link to the source website.
* This site is current and trendy, with a modern, cohesive design.  It features a soft, approachable colour palette with oversize, sans   serif, centered type and striking images.  
* This site has a familiar navigation system, with a simple menu bar and navigation buttons within the homepage to jump directly to       additional content pages.  I found it very easy to navigate.
* The site features a journal subscription signup (with posts and recipes), store and shopping cart, social media posting buttons and a   contact form.  Also has a seperate contact for 
* I find this site delicious!  It is visually pleasing and informative.
* I would add video content of their "bean to bar process" and perhaps video recipes.

## Site 2
* https://themindsjournal.com/
* I selected another appealing image on Pinterest and followed the link to the source website.
* It is not terribly dated looking as the white background and sans serif type are modern, but the design is amateurish and chaotic with   lots of competing images and loosely-spaced typography that feels like everything is shouting for attention. The logo features an       ugly script font and nondescript bird illustration.
* The navigation system is somewhat confusing, with a menu bar featuring extensive drop-downs and a seperate hamburger menu with the       same options, only for submission.  The pages scroll endlessly, with "load more" buttons if you want to keep right on going (which I     did not).
* There are search boxes on multiple pages, register/login page, social media buttons to post on every platform I know, a video player,   voting buttons, submission links and personality tests.
* This site is visually a mess, but it is very informative. It's a shame that the content is so disorganized because if it was designed   well I would spend time there. 
* I would ORGANIZE the content to make it a more appealing read.

## Site 3
* https://www.balletforadults.com/
* Again I selected a random Pinterest image
* It has an overall current appearance, with a nice contrast of black with ballet pink and soft grey.  A modern sans serif typeface is     used throughout, but the unfortunately centered text is a bit awkward-looking.
* It has a familiar menu bar navigation that makes it easy to find things.
* This site is rich in interactive elements.  You can search for classes by country, listen to podcasts, watch video lessons, post to     social media, mailing list signup, shopping with cart, brand engagement and contact forms.
* The site is targeted to a limited niche and would be very interesting if I were an adult student ballet dancer.  While I wouldn't say   it's beautiful, it is not unattractive either.  
* On the home page, there is only a very small logo with the business identity on the left side of the page.  I would put a larger         heading with the company name visible when you enter the site.

## Site 4
* http://www.thecutecats.com/
* Pinterest again!
* The appearance is clumsy and amateurish and I was not surprised to discover that it was built from a Wordpress theme.  The only word     that I can think of to describe it is "basic". The design is not current or dated, just nonexistant.
* The navigation is very simple, with a basic menu bar.  It was easy to find content.
* There are very limited interactive elements, just a subscription sign up, social media buttons and a silly quiz.  There is a "news"     banner at the top featuring some blog posts, which you can click to read more.
* I found this site to be silly and childish, with very poor grammar and grade school level content.  While the cat pics are cute, it     would take much more than that to keep me there.
* I would get some decent content!

## Site 5
* https://wafflestopsrq.wordpress.com/
* And...drumroll, please...Pinterest (surprised?)
* This site is very dated and UGLY.  The background is Elvis wallpaper that is mostly obscured, leaving little Elvis arms and legs         sticking out. It is built from an old WordPress blog template and it shows!  Most of the images are fuzzy and/or pixilated (some are     even distorted) and they are "plopped" onto the site with no rhyme or reason.
* To reach the menu bar, you have to scroll below a very large picture, so it it "below the fold".  There are three menu options, two of   which provide a blurb about the waffle restaurant, and the third is the home page (Elvis gallery).  It was hard to find but simple to   use.
* There is a search box, which does nothing, and a follow button where you can sign up for the blog (why???)
* This site is pointless and very unattractive.
* I would remove the site so nobody else has to look at it, but if I couldn't and I had to choose one thing to change it would be to       remove the obscured Elvis background in favor of a solid colour or simple pattern.
